That is me and my mother. It was difficult when we chose to leave our home country
and start a new live in a differenct country. For a long time I did not understand
the troubles my parents had. Especially my mother gave her best to not let me worry
about the obsticles she had to overcome.

Thanks to her I could focus on having fun and follow my passion. I started acting
in Frankfurt am Main in "theaterperipherie". We focused on pieces related to immigration.
